                <em><strong>The transitional object, what is it ? </strong></em>
                <br>
                Donald Winnicott, a paediatrician and psychoanalyst, developed the theory of attachment and created the transitional 
                object at the end of the Second World War. A « transitional object » is most of the time an object chosen by the child ;
                 it is the way in which it is invested by the child that counts. When we talk about « transitional objects », the comforter is 
                 both « an extension of the mother, but also a little of the baby himself », notes psychologist Suzanne Vallières.
                 <br>
                 Its smell is often important because it reminds the baby of good times in its secure environment. 
                A participatory experiment involving a thousand people aged between 3 and 72 showed that it is above all the emotional 
                bond with a cuddly stuffed that makes it so comforting.
                <br>
                This object can have many forms, It could be a rabbit, a teddy bear, one of the parents' clothes, a toy or something else. 
                It's an object that the child chooses or has had since baby.
                <br>
                But what does it mean to the child and why is it important ?

                <em><strong>What does it mean to the child ?</strong></em>
                <br>
                Around the age of 6 to 8 months, a baby realises that it can be separated from its parents, 
                which causes anxiety in the young child. Step by step, the comforter becomes an object that can accompany 
                them during playtime or when they are separated. In this way, the mother or father, even if absent, 
                can still be symbolically present for the child. Hence the name « transitional object », 
                because it symbolically represents the attachment figure. 
                <br>
                But who is the attachment figure?

                <em><strong>The attachment figure</strong></em>
                <br>
                After 7 months, at a time when children are becoming better at distinguishing between strangers and familiar people, 
                they begin to develop an attachment relationship with a particular person. The attachment figure is the person towards 
                whom the child directs his attachment behavior. It’s a person taking physical and emotional care of the child, 
                having an important and regular presence in his life and investing him emotionally. So everyone who engages in 
                sustained social interaction with the child and responds to his need for reassurance when under stress is likely to 
                become an attachment figure.

                <em><strong>How it’s invested in the infrastructure ?</strong></em>
                <br>
                In this kindergarten, the comforter is accessible to the children. They are free to take it when they need it or to leave it. 
                Children can either bring their comforter in their bag in the morning, or they can leave one in the kindergarten, 
                which is always there. Most of the time, children use their comforter during separation, playtime or when they're tired, 
                to reassure themselves and regain a sense of security. Most children forget it or leave it out, they often take it at 
                their afternoon nap and then, take it back or leave it in their bed for the next day.
                <br>
                For Suzanne Vallières, the comforter has an essential function in the nursery and must be made freely accessible to the child. 
                For her, it makes the child more independent and provides a transition between the known and the unknown. 
                It helps him make the transition between home and nursery. This psychologist insists : « threatening to take away a child's 
                comforter is like threatening to take away an extension of their mother and themselves ».

                <em><strong>Are there times when children need their comforter more than others ?</strong></em>
                <br>
                New environments, such as starting a new nursery, going to a new school or visiting an unfamiliar person, 
                are all occasions when children are most likely to need their comforter. A child who is in pain or needs 
                reassurance looks to their comforter for a source of consolation and tenderness : there's nothing like a good 
                cuddle from a real person !
                <br>
                From an article by journalist Paulina Jonquières d'Oriola (2019), if the comforter is given to the young child 
                as soon as he starts to cry, without first understanding the nature of his discomfort or trying to reassure him, 
                then he won't be able to distinguish between the emotions that can make him cry (fear, hunger, pain, tiredness, etc.). 
                As we saw earlier, the transitional object helps to support absence. By contrast, if the comforter is offered as a 
                solution to every situation, it loses this function and becomes a « fetish ». The child can consequently become totally 
                « dependent », and will find it difficult to break free.

                <em><strong>Is there an age at which children gradually become detached from their comforter ?</strong></em>
                <br>
                As children get older, they gradually detach themselves from their comforter when it’s used as a transitional object. 
                This becomes less essential as the child speaks and turns towards others : the anxiety of being separated from his 
                parents is less intense. There is no rules, but usually, children start to forget their comforter around the age of 2. 
                The comforter will therefore be put aside for playtime, and then gradually abandoned when they starts school. 
                Around the age of 3, the comforter gradually ceases to be an everyday companion. More secure, the child turns 
                more and more to the adult present or to his peers.
                <br>
                However, each person is different, and there are no rules - everyone goes at their own pace !
